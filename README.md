![2024-04-21 08-11-32 00_00_11_24 Still001](https://github.com/souki03/ped-menu/assets/53879234/4c2c158f-23b5-4f98-ad9d-1dc7d67d2246)
I had already previously made a menu which listed all the peds, but I found it a shame that there was no preview of the ped, so I created this menu in nui with the preview ones for each ped.

# All Peds

You can see all the peds in the `html/index.html` file.
The list comes from this site: https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/ped-models/

# Setup / Installation

- Just add this resource to your server
- And add this line in your server.cfg
	> `start ped-menu`
