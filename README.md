# Ped Menu With All Preview
I had already previously made a menu which listed all the peds ([Ped Menu RageUI](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-free-menu-ped-rageui/4859367/1)), but I found it a shame that there was no preview of the ped, so I created this menu in nui with the preview ones for each ped.
